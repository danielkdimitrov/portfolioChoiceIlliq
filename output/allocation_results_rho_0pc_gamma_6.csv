- Allocation Benefit for including the illiquid asset is large but declines sharply with more that 2 years of waiting time to trade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- the Allocation to  the liquid assets barely moves. Cash buffers build up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- the cost of diversification however is the higher dispersion of xi. Overallocation to the illiquid asset occurs much more often and to a larger extend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"-the lower the correlation, the less the investor can use the liquid asset to hedge movements in the illiquid one. the higher the dispersion in consumption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"- No substitution effect. The investor is exposed more to illiquidity risk, in the form of reducing consumption below the alternative (no investment in the illiquid asset)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
